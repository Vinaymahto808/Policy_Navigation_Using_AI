## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Text Extraction Flow
1. **File Upload**: User uploads PDF or image file
2. **File Type Detection**: System determines file type and processing method
3. **Processing Path Selection**:
   - **Digital PDF**: Direct text extraction using PyMuPDF
   - **Scanned PDF**: Convert to images ‚Üí OCR processing
   - **Image Files**: Direct OCR processing
4. **Image Preprocessing**: Enhance image quality for better OCR
   - Format normalization (handle RGBA, grayscale, etc.)
   - Noise reduction using OpenCV
   - Threshold adjustment for text clarity
5. **Text Extraction**: Extract text using Tesseract OCR
6. **Output Generation**: 
   - Display text in interface
   - Generate XML structured output
   - Provide download options

### Error Handling and Fallbacks
- **Robust Image Processing**: Handles various image formats and modes
- **OCR Fallback**: If preprocessing fails, attempts OCR on original image
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even if some features fail

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Running the Application
The application runs on Streamlit with the following configuration:
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (accessible from any interface)
- **Port**: 5000
- **Mode**: Headless (no browser auto-open)

### Usage Instructions
1. **Upload File**: Click "Choose a file to upload" and select a PDF or image
2. **View Results**: Extracted text appears in the text area
3. **Download**: Use download buttons for text (.txt) or XML format
4. **Chat**: Interact with the extracted content (placeholder functionality)

## üîí Security Considerations

- File uploads are stored in temporary directory
- No persistent storage of user data
- OCR processing is performed locally
- XML output is properly formatted and escaped

## üéØ Performance Optimizations

- **Headless OpenCV**: Reduced memory footprint for server deployment
- **Image Preprocessing**: Optimized for OCR accuracy
- **Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback strategies for robust operation
- **Efficient File Handling**: Temporary storage with automatic cleanup

## üìà Future Enhancements

- Integration with Large Language Models for intelligent document analysis
- Batch processing for multiple files
- Advanced text analysis and entity extraction using spaCy
- API endpoints using FastAPI for programmatic access
- Enhanced security with filename sanitization
- Progress indicators for long-running OCR operations

## ü§ù Contributing

This project uses a modular architecture making it easy to extend:
- Add new file format support in `backend/` modules
- Enhance OCR accuracy with additional preprocessing
- Integrate new text analysis capabilities
- Improve user interface with additional Streamlit components
